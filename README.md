concept = Concept(h)
concept.construct_concepts([(u'type of sport', 2), [2,4]])
```

## Assign background corpus to category of interest
If we want to assign documents to one dimension, for example, sports "baseball, basketball, football and etc.". We will just need top@k relevant documents to these category nodes.
